          <li>Point: location, no size, named with a capital letter (A).</li><br>
          <li>Line: infinite, two directions, named by two points (AB) or a lowercase letter (ℓ).</li><br>
          <li>Plane: flat, infinite surface, named by three non-collinear points (Plane ABC).</li><br>
          <li>Collinear Points: points on same line.</li><br>
          <li>Coplanar Points: points on same plane.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Points:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>What is it?: An undefined term, but can be refered to as a location.</li><br>
          <li>What is it like?: It's a dot with no dimension</li><br>
          <li>How is it named?: Point A.. or just "A".</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

          Lines:<br> 
        <ul>
          <li>What is it?: Undefined term.</li><br>
          <li>What is it like?: No thickness, goes forever, straight, and one dimensional.</li><br>
          <li>How is it named?: m, AB, BA (with a line symbol on the top)</li>
        </ul>

          Planes:<br> 
        <ul>
          <li>What is it?: Undefined term.</li><br>
          <li>What is it like?: No thickness, goes forever in both dimensions, 2 dimensional.</li><br>
          <li>How is it named?: Plane R or Plane ABC (strictly only 3 points to name a plane).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Segment:<br> 
        <ul>
          <li>What is it?: Part of a line.</li><br>
          <li>What is it like?: Part of a line between 2 endpoints, does NOT go on forever.</li><br>
          <li>How is it named?: AB, BA (with just a line on top not a line symbol)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Ray:<br> 
        <ul>
          <li>What is it?: Part of a line.</li><br>
          <li>What is it like?: Part of a line starting at one endpoint and continuing forever. Goes forever in one direction only.</li><br>
          <li>How is it named?: BA, named by the endpoint first then by one other point.</li>
        </ul>

          Postulates:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Through any 2 points, exactly one line.</li><br>
          <li>Through any 3 non-collinear points, exactly one plane.</li><br>
          <li>The intersection of 2 lines is 1 point.</li><br>
          <li>The intersection of 2 planes is 1 line.</li><br>
        </ul>

        Worked Example:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Q: Are points A, B, C collinear if AB = 3, BC = 5, AC = 8?</li><br>
          <li>A: Yes, because AB (3) + BC (5) = AC (8).<br><br></li>
        </ul>

        Insert Diagram:<br><br>

        A labeled plane ABC with points drawn.<br>
        Two intersecting planes showing their intersection line.<br>
