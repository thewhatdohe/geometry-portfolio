  <h3>1.1 — Points, Lines, and Planes</h3>

  <div class="objectives">
    <strong>Learning objectives:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Define point, line, plane; know naming conventions.</li>
      <li>Recognize collinear and coplanar sets of points.</li>
      <li>Apply postulates about lines/planes and intersections.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="vocab">
    <strong>Key vocabulary:</strong> Point, Line, Plane, Collinear, Coplanar, Space, Intersection.
  </div>

  <p><strong>Core idea:</strong> Geometry begins with a few undefined terms — point, line, and plane — which we accept and use to build precise language. A point is a location; a line goes forever in two directions; a plane is a flat sheet extending infinitely. Convention and notation matter. If you write sloppy labels on tests, you will lose easy marks.</p>

  <div class="worked-example">
    <h4>Worked example — reasoned</h4>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are points A, B, C collinear if AB = 3, BC = 5, AC = 8?</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>What it asks:</strong> Do A, B, C lie on the same straight line?</li>
      <li><strong>Key fact:</strong> If B is between A and C, AB + BC = AC (Segment Addition Postulate).</li>
      <li>Check numeric: 3 + 5 = 8 → AB + BC = AC holds.</li>
      <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Yes — the three points are collinear and B is between A and C.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="practice">
    <strong>Practice:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>If P(0,0), Q(2,0), R(4,0) are points on a plane, are they collinear? <span class="answer">Yes — all have y = 0 (same line).</span></li>
      <li>Give an example of three coplanar but not collinear points. <span class="answer">Any three points forming a triangle, e.g. (0,0),(1,0),(0,1).</span></li>
      <li>State the postulate that says “through any two points there is exactly one line.” <span class="answer">Through any two points there is exactly one line.</span></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="exam-tip">
    <strong>Exam tips:</strong> Label diagrams clearly. When asked if points are collinear/coplanar always give a reason (e.g. AB+BC=AC, or same line equation). If coordinate points are given, plug into line equation to check.

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I lost marks early because of notation errors (plane naming & commas). I created a one-page notation cheat-sheet and practiced labeling diagrams; that immediately reduced careless errors. I'm used to having simple syntax problems in many things, so I've decided that now I will not only learn how to solve equations and problems, I will make sure I solve them accurately and using correct notation.</p>
