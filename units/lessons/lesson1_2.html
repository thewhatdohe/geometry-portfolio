  <h3>1.2 — Segment Addition, Congruence & Bisectors</h3>

  <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A segment is the finite piece of a line between two endpoints. If a point B lies between A and C then AB + BC = AC. Congruent segments have equal lengths and we use ≅ to show congruence. A segment bisector intersects a segment at its midpoint.</p>

    <h4>Worked example — algebra + geometry</h4>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> AB = 2x, BC = 3x − 4, AC = 11. Find x and lengths.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use segment addition: AB + BC = AC → 2x + (3x − 4) = 11.</li>
      <li>Simplify: 5x − 4 = 11 → 5x = 15 → x = 3.</li>
      <li>Compute lengths: AB = 6, BC = 5, check AB + BC = 11 OK.</li>
      <li><strong>Answer:</strong> x = 3; AB = 6, BC = 5.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="practice">
    <ol>
      <li>If M is midpoint of AB and AM = 5, MB = (2x − 1). Solve x. <span class="answer">x = 3.</span></li>
      <li>Given XY ≅ ZW and XY = 7, state ZW. <span class="answer">ZW = 7.</span></li>
      <li>Is the midpoint always unique? Explain. <span class="answer">Yes — a segment has exactly one midpoint.</span></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="exam-tip">
    Memorize the structure: <strong>postulate → equation → solve → check</strong>. Always perform a numerical check AB + BC = AC after solving for x.

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I found algebra in segments straightforward. When I make mistakes it’s usually forgetting the “+ BC” part during substitution —  so I simply slow down and label each step to get it done in a comfortable amount of time and in an accurate and correct manner.</p>
