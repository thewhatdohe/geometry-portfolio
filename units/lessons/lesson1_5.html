  <h3>1.5 — Angle Relationships & Proofs</h3>

  <div class="objectives">
    <ul>
      <li>Identify complementary, supplementary, adjacent, linear pair, and vertical angles</li>
      <li>Use algebra to find angle measures</li>
      <li>Write short two-column proofs for basic theorems</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Key relationships:</strong> Complementary: sum 90°. Supplementary: sum 180°. Vertical: opposite angles formed by intersecting lines — they are equal. Linear pairs are adjacent and supplementary.</p>

  <div class="worked-example">
    <h4>Worked example — algebraic angles</h4>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> ∠LMN = (4x − 2)°, ∠PQR = (9x + 1)°, and they are complementary. Find x and both angles.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Write equation: (4x − 2) + (9x + 1) = 90.</li>
      <li>Simplify: 13x − 1 = 90 ⇒ 13x = 91.</li>
      <li>x = 7. Compute angles: ∠LMN = 4(7) − 2 = 26°; ∠PQR = 9(7) + 1 = 64°.</li>
      <li>Check: 26 + 64 = 90°, correct.</li>
    </ol>

  <div class="practice">
    <ol>
      <li>If two angles form a linear pair and one is 110°, find the other. <span class="answer">70° (supplementary → 180 − 110).</span></li>
      <li>Find x if angles (3x + 10) and (2x − 5) are supplementary. <span class="answer">3x+10 + 2x−5 = 180 ⇒ 5x +5 =180 ⇒ x=35 ⇒ angles: 115°, 70°.</span></li>
      <li>Explain why vertical angles are congruent in your own words. <span class="answer">Two intersecting lines create opposite angles that share the same rays; using linear pair equalities we subtract and get equality.</span></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="exam-tip">
    For proofs, write each statement and reason clearly. If stuck, start by labeling what is given and then list which postulate or theorem can connect to the goal.

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I initially saw angle relationships as just simple algebra problems. The proof unit showed me they are the foundation for logical structure in geometry. Using the Linear Pair Postulate and the definition of supplementary angles to logically prove that vertical angles are congruent was a key insight. It's not just memorizing that they're equal; it's understanding <em>why</em> through a chain of deductive reasoning. Writing two-column proofs forced me to justify every step, which solidified the connection between the given information, the theorems, and the final conclusion.</p>
