  <h3>1.6 — Perpendicular and Parallel Lines</h3>

  <div class="objectives">
    <ul>
      <li>Identify perpendicular and parallel lines in diagrams</li>

  <p><strong>Core idea:</strong> Perpendicular lines intersect at right angles (90°). Parallel lines never intersect and have the same slope. A perpendicular bisector is a line that intersects a segment at its midpoint and forms right angles with it.</p>

    <h4>Worked example — perpendicular bisector</h4>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of segment AB with A(2,3) and B(4,7).</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find midpoint: M = ((2+4)/2, (3+7)/2) = (3,5)</li>
      <li>Find slope of AB: (7-3)/(4-2) = 4/2 = 2</li>
      <li>Perpendicular slope is negative reciprocal: -1/2</li>
      <li>Use point-slope form with midpoint: y - 5 = -1/2(x - 3)</li>
      <li><strong>Answer:</strong> y = -1/2x + 6.5</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="practice">
    <ol>
      <li>Are lines with slopes 2 and -1/2 perpendicular? <span class="answer">Yes (negative reciprocals).</span></li>
      <li>Find the slope of a line parallel to y = 3x - 5. <span class="answer">3 (same slope).</span></li>
      <li>If line p ⟂ line q and line q ∥ line r, what is the relationship between p and r? <span class="answer">p ⟂ r (perpendicular).</span></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="exam-tip">
    Remember: Perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals. Parallel slopes are equal. Always find the midpoint first when constructing perpendicular bisectors.

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I initially confused perpendicular and parallel slope relationships. Creating a quick reference card with "Parallel = Same Slope" and "Perpendicular = Negative Reciprocal" helped me remember. When constructing perpendicular bisectors, I now always follow the three steps: find midpoint, find original slope, then use negative reciprocal. This systematic approach has eliminated my previous errors.</p>
